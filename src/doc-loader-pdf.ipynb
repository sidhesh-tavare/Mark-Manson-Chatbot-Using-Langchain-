      "a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet. He’s probably the\n",
      "last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to see in\n",
      "any sort of self-help book.\n",
      "Which is why he’s the perfect place to start.\n",
      "Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected\n",
      "by almost every magazine, newspaper, journal, agent, and publisher he\n",
      "submitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.\n",
      "And as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed\n",
      "him deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of\n",
      "his life.\n",
      "Bukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit\n",
      "money and spent most of it on booze. He \n",
      "gambled away the rest at the\n",
      "racetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry\n",
      "on his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having\n",
      "passed out the night before.\n",
      "Thirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol,\n",
      "drugs, gambling, and prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a\n",
      "lifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent\n",
      "publishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn’t offer\n",
      "Bukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird\n",
      "affection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was\n",
      "the first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he realized, probably the\n",
      "only one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one\n",
      "of two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and\n",
      "play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks.\n",
      "It was called simply \n",
      "Post Office.\n",
      " In the dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to\n",
      "nobody.”\n",
      "Bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and\n",
      "publish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of\n",
      "his books. His popularity defied everyone’s expectations, particularly his\n",
      "own.\n",
      "Stories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative.\n",
      "Bukowski’s life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he\n",
      "wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s\n",
      "practically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski’s\n",
      "and \n",
      "say, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always\n",
      "believed in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of\n",
      "himself!”\n",
      "It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t\n",
      "try.”\n",
      "See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew\n",
      "it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but\n",
      "from the fact that he \n",
      "knew\n",
      " he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly\n",
      "about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in\n",
      "Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing\n",
      "himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple\n",
      "ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the\n",
      "worst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.\n",
      "This is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a\n",
      "failure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he\n",
      "still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in\n",
      "his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every\n",
      "woman he could find. Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor\n",
      "was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.\n",
      "Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t\n",
      "necessarily mean they’re the same thing.\n",
      "Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive\n",
      "expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be\n",
      "smarter, faster, richer, sexier, \n",
      "more popular, more productive, more envied,\n",

      "But when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice—all\n",

      "lake. The autopsy would later say that his legs had cramped up due to\n",
      "dehydration from the alcohol, as well as to the impact of the jump from the\n",

      "on black. No one could see where his screams for help were coming from.\n",
      "Just the splashes. Just the sounds. His parents later told me that he was a\n",
      "terrible swimmer. I’d had no idea.\n",
      "It took me twelve hours to let myself cry. I was in my car, driving back\n",
      "home to Austin the next morning. I called my dad and told him that I was still\n",
      "near Dallas and that I was going to miss work. (I’d been working for him that\n",
      "summer.) He asked, “Why; what happened? Is everything \n",
      "all right?” Andthat’s when it all came out: the waterworks. The wails and the screams and\n",
      "the snot. I pulled the car over to the side of the road and clutched the phone\n",
      "and cried the way a little boy cries to his father.\n",
      "I went into a deep depression that summer. I thought I’d been depressed\n",
      "before, but this was a whole new level of meaninglessness—sadness so deep\n",
      "that it physically hurt. People would come by and try to cheer me up, and I\n",
      "would sit there and hear them say all the right things and do all the right\n",
      "things; and I would tell them thank you and how nice it was of them to come\n",
      "over, and I would fake a smile and lie and say that it was getting better, but\n",
      "underneath I just felt nothing.\n",
      "I dreamed about Josh for a few months after that. Dreams where he and I\n",
      "would have full-blown conversations about life and death, as well as about\n",
      "random, pointless things. Up until that point in my life, I had been a pretty\n",
      "typical middle-class stoner kid: lazy, irresponsible, socially anxious, and\n",
      "deeply insecure. Josh, in many ways, had been a person I looked up to. He\n",
      "was older, more confident, more experienced, and more accepting of and\n",
      "open to the world around him. In one of my last dreams of Josh, I was sitting\n",
      "in a Jacuzzi with him (yeah, I know, weird), and I said something like, “I’m\n",
      "really sorry you died.” He laughed. I don’t remember exactly what his words\n",
      "were, but he said something like, “Why do you care that I’m dead when\n",
      "you’re still so afraid to live?” I woke up crying.\n",
      "It was sitting on my mom’s couch that summer, staring into the so-called\n",
      "abyss, seeing the endless and incomp\n",
      "rehensible nothingness where Josh’s\n",
      "friendship used to be, when I came to the startling realization that if there\n",
      "really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to \n",
      "not\n",
      " do\n",
      "anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to\n",
      "ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a\n",
      "bunch of nothing anyway; and that by spending the majority of my short life\n",
      "avoiding what was painful and uncomfortable, I had essentially been\n",
      "avoiding being alive at all.\n",
      "That summer, I gave up the weed and the cigarettes and the video games.\n",
      "I gave up my silly rock star fantasies and dropped out of music school and\n",
      "signed up for college courses. I started going to the gym and lost a bunch of\n",
      "weight. I made new friends. I got my first girlfriend. For the first time in my\n",
      "life I actually studied for classes, gaining me the startling realization that I\n",
      "could make good grades if only I gave a shit. The next summer, I challengedmyself to read fifty nonfiction books in fifty days, and then did it. The\n",
      "following year, I transferred to an excellent university on the other side of the\n",

      "Josh’s death marks the clearest before/after point I can identify in my life.\n",
      "Pre-tragedy, I was inhibited, unambitious, forever obsessed and confined by\n",
      "what I imagined the world might be thinking of me. Post-tragedy, I morphed\n",
      "into a new person: responsible, curious,hardworking. I still had my\n",
      "insecurities and my baggage—as we always do—but now I gave a fuck about\n",
      "something more important than my insecurities and my baggage. \n",
      "And that\n",
      "made all the difference. Oddly, it was someone else’s death that gave me\n",
      "permission to finally live. And perhaps the worst moment of my life was also\n",
      "the most transformational.\n",
      "Death scares us. And because it scares us, we avoid thinking about it,\n",
      "talking about it, sometimes even acknowledging it, even when it’s happening\n",
      "to someone close to us.\n",
      "Yet, in a bizarre, backwards way, death is the light by which the shadow\n",

      "Something Beyond Our Selves\n",
      "Ernest Becker was an academic outcast. In 1960, he got his Ph.D. in\n",
      "anthropology; his doctoral research compared the unlikely and\n",
      "unconventional practices of Zen Buddhism and psychoanalysis. At the time,\n",
      "Zen was seen as something for hippies and drug addicts, and Freudian\n",
      "psychoanalysis was considered a quack form of psychology left over from the\n",
      "Stone Age.\n",
      "In his first job as an assistant professor, Becker quickly fell into a crowd\n",
      "that denounced the practice of psychiatry as a form of fascism. They saw the\n",
      "practice as an unscientific form of oppression against the weak and helpless.\n",
      "The problem was that Becker’s boss was a psychiatrist. So it was kind of\n",
      "like walking into your first job and proudly comparing your boss to Hitler.\n",
      "As you can imagine, he was fired.\n",
      "So Becker took his radical ideas somewhere that they \n",
      "might be accepted:\n",
      "Berkeley, California. But this, too, didn’t last long.Because it wasn’t just his anti-establishment tendencies that got Becker\n",
      "into trouble; it was his odd teaching methods as well. He would use\n",
      "Shakespeare to teach psychology, psychology textbooks to teach\n",
      "anthropology, and anthropological data to teach sociology. He’d dress up as\n",
      "King Lear and do mock sword fights in class and go on long political rants\n",
      "that had little to do with the lesson plan. His students adored him. The other\n",
      "faculty loathed him. Less than a year later, he was fired again.\n",
      "Becker then landed at San Francisco State University, where he actually\n",
      "kept his job for more than a year. But when student protests erupted over the\n",
      "Vietnam War, the university called in the National Guard and things got\n",
      "violent. When Becker sided with the students and publicly condemned the\n",
      "actions of the dean (again, his boss being Hitleresque and everything), he\n",
      "was, once again, promptly fired.\n",
      "Becker changed jobs four times in six years. And before he could get\n",
      "fired from the fifth, he got colon cancer. The prognosis was grim. He spent\n",
      "the next few years bedridden and had little hope of surviving. So Becker\n",
      "decided to write a book. This book would be about death.\n",
      "Becker died in 1974. His book \n",
      "The Denial of Death, \n",
      "would win the\n",
      "Pulitzer Prize and become one of the most influential intellectual works of the\n",
      "twentieth century, shaking up the fields of psychology and anthropology,\n",
      "while making profound philosophical claims that are still influential today.\n",
      "The Denial of Death \n",
      "essentially makes two points:\n",
      "1.    Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize\n",
      "and think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don’t sit around and worry\n",
      "about their career. Cats don’t think about their past mistakes or wonder\n",
      "what would have happened if they’d done something differently.\n",
      "Monkeys don’t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don’t sit around\n",
      "wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins.\n",
      "As humans, we’re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in\n",
      "hypothetical situations, to contemplate both the past and the future, to\n",
      "imagine other realities or situations where things might be different. And\n",
      "it’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at\n",
      "some point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because\n",
      "we’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the\n",
      "only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it.This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep\n",
      "existential anxiety that underlies \n",
      "everything \n",
      "we think or do.\n",
      "2.   Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two\n",
      "“selves.” The first self is the physical self—the one that eats, sleeps,\n",
      "snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self—our identity, or\n",
      "how we see ourselves.\n",
      "Becker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some \n",
      "level that our\n",
      "physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its\n",
      "inevitability—on some unconscious level—scares the shit out of us.\n",
      "Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our\n",
      "physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever.\n",
      "This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues,\n",
      "on spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time\n",
      "giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our\n",
      "influence—our conceptual self—will last way beyond our physical self.\n",
      "That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our\n",
      "physical self ceases to exist.\n",
      "Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that\n",
      "allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical\n",
      "death. All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of\n",
      "immortality projects: the cities and governments and structures and\n",
      "authorities in place today were all immortality projects of men and\n",
      "women who came before us. They are the remnants of conceptual selves\n",
      "that ceased to die. Names like Jesus, Muhammad, Napoleon, and\n",
      "Shakespeare are just as powerful today as when those men lived, if not\n",
      "more so. And that’s the whole point. Whether it be through mastering an\n",
      "art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a\n",
      "large and loving family that will live on for generations, \n",
      "all the meaning\n",
      "in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die.\n",
      "Religion, politics, sports, art, and technological innovation are the result\n",
      "of people’s immortality projects. Becker argues that wars and revolutions and\n",
      "mass murder occur when one group of people’s immortality projects rub up\n",
      "against another group’s. Centuries of oppression and the bloodshed of\n",
      "millions have been justified as the defense of one group’s immortality project\n",
      "against another’s.But, when our immortality projects fail, when the meaning is lost, when\n",
      "the prospect of our conceptual self outliving our physical self no longer\n",
      "seems possible or likely, death terror—that horrible, depressing anxiety—\n",
      "creeps back into our mind. Trauma can cause this, as can shame and social\n",
      "ridicule. As can, as Becker points out, mental illness.\n",
      "If you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values.\n",
      "They are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our\n",
      "values fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in\n",
      "essence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about\n",
      "something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that\n",
      "distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly\n",
      "not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the\n",
      "impermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to\n",
      "get caught up in various forms of entitlement.\n",
      "Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s\n",
      "immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather\n",
      "than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self\n",
      "across the world, people should question their conceptual \n",
      "self and become\n",
      "more comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the\n",
      "bitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he stared down\n",
      "his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable. Therefore, we should not\n",
      "avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can.\n",
      "Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the\n",
      "root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions\n",
      "—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical\n",
      "quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.\n",
      "The Sunny Side of Death\n",
      "I step from rock to rock, climbing steadily, leg muscles stretching and aching.\n",
      "In that trancelike state that comes from slow, repetitive physical exertion, I’m\n",
      "nearing the top. The sky gets wide and deep. I’m alone now. My friends are\n",
      "far below me, taking pictures of the ocean.\n",
      "Finally, I climb over a small boulder and the view opens up. I can see\n",
      "from here to the infinite horizon. It feels as though I’m staring at the edge of\n",
      "the earth, where water meets the sky, blue on blue. The wind screams acrossmy skin. I look up. It’s bright. It’s beautiful.\n",
      "I’m at South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, once thought to be the\n",
      "southern tip of Africa and the southernmost point in the world. It’s a\n",
      "tumultuous place, a place full of storms and treacherous waters. A place\n",
      "that’s seen centuries of trade and commerce and human endeavor. A place,\n",
      "ironically, of lost hopes.\n",
      "There is a saying in Portuguese: \n",
      "Ele dobra o Cabo da Boa Esperança. \n",
      "It\n",
      "means, “He’s rounding the Cape of Good Hope.” Ironically, it means that the\n",
      "person’s life is in its final phase, that he’s incapable of accomplishing\n",
      "anything more.\n",
      "I step across the rocks toward the blue, allowing its vastness to engulf my\n",
      "field of vision. I’m sweating yet cold. Excited yet nervous. \n",
      "Is this it?\n",
      "The wind is slapping my ears. I hear nothing, but I see the edge: where\n",
      "the rock meets oblivion. I stop and stand for a moment, several yards away. I\n",
      "can see the ocean below, lapping and frothing against cliffs stretching out for\n",
      "miles to either side. The tides are furious against the impenetrable walls.\n",
      "Straight ahead, it’s a sheer drop of at least fifty yards to the water below.\n",
      "To my right, tourists are dotted across the landscape below, snapping\n",
      "photos and aggregating themselves into antlike formations. To my left is\n",
      "Asia. In front of me is the sky and behind is me is everything I’ve ever hoped\n",
      "for and brought with me.\n",
      "What if this is it? What if this is all there is?\n",
      "I look around. I’m alone. I take my first step toward the edge of the cliff.\n",
      "The human body seems to come equipped with a natural radar for death-\n",
      "inducing situations. For example, the moment you get within about ten feet of\n",
      "a cliff edge, minus guardrail, a certain tension digs into your body. Your back\n",
      "stiffens. Your skin ripples. Your eyes become hyperfocused on every detail\n",
      "of your environment. Your feet feel \n",
      "as though they’re made of rock. It’s as if\n",
      "there were a big, invisible magnet gently pulling your body back to safety.\n",
      "But I fight the magnet. I drag the feet made of rock closer to the edge.\n",
      "At five feet away, your mind joins the party. You can now see not only\n",
      "the edge of the cliff, but \n",
      "down \n",
      "the cliff face itself, which induces all sorts of\n",
      "unwanted visualizations of tripping and falling and tumbling to a splashy\n",
      "death. It’s really fucking far, your mind reminds you. Like, \n",
      "really\n",
      " fucking far.\n",
      "Dude, what are you doing? Stop moving. Stop it.\n",
      "I tell my mind to shut up, and keep inching forward.At three feet, your body goes into full-scale red alert. You are now within\n",
      "an errant shoelace-trip of your life ending. It feels as though a hefty gust of\n",
      "wind could send you sailing off into that blue-bisected eternity. Your legs\n",
      "shake. As do your hands. As does your voice, in case you need to remind\n",
      "yourself you’re not about to plummet to your death.\n",
      "The three-foot distance is most people’s absolute limit. It’s just close\n",
      "enough to lean forward and catch a glimpse of the bottom, but still far enough\n",
      "to feel as though you’re not at any real risk of killing yourself. Standing that\n",
      "close to the edge of a cliff, even one as beautiful and mesmerizing as the\n",
      "Cape of Good Hope, induces a heady sense of vertigo, and threatens to\n",
      "regurgitate any recent meal.\n",
      "Is this it? Is this all there is? Do I already know everything I will ever\n",
      "know?\n",
      "I take another microstep, then another. Two feet now. My forward leg\n",
      "vibrates as I put the weight of my body \n",
      "on it. I shuffle on. Against the\n",
      "magnet. Against my mind. Against all my better instincts for survival.\n",
      "One foot now. I’m now looking straight down the cliff face. I feel a\n",
      "sudden urge to cry. My body instinctively crouches, protecting itself against\n",
      "something imagined and inexplicable. The wind comes in hailstorms. The\n",
      "thoughts come in right hooks.\n",

      "down feels as though you’re part of the sky itself. You actually kind of expect\n",
      "to fall at this point.\n",
      "I crouch there for a moment, catching my breath, collecting my thoughts.\n",
      "I force myself to stare down at the water hitting the rocks below me. Then I\n",
      "look again to my right, at the little ants milling about the signage below me,\n",
      "snapping photos, chasing tour buses, on the off chance that somebody\n",
      "somehow sees me. This desire for attention is wholly irrational. But so is all\n",
      "of this. It’s impossible to make me out up here, of course. And even if it\n",
      "weren’t, there’s nothing that those distant people could say or do.\n",
      "All I hear is the wind.\n",
      "Is this it?\n",
      "My body shudders, the fear becoming euphoric and blinding. I focus my\n",
      "mind and clear my thoughts in a kind of meditation. Nothing makes you\n",
      "present and mindful like being mere inches away from your own death. I\n",
      "straighten up and look out again, and find myself smiling. I remind myselfthat it’s all right to die.\n",
      "This willing and even exuberant interfacing with one’s own mortality has\n",
      "ancient roots. The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome implored people to\n",
      "keep death in mind at all times, in order to appreciate life more and remain\n",
      "humble in the face of its adversities. In various forms of Buddhism, the\n",
      "practice of meditation is often taught as a means of preparing oneself for\n",
      "death while still remaining alive. Dissolving one’s ego into an expansive\n",
      "nothingness—achieving the enlightened state of nirvana—is seen as a trial\n",
      "run of letting oneself cross to the other side. Even Mark Twain, that hairy\n",

      "follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any\n",

      "Back on the cliff, I bend down, slightly leaning back. I put my hands on the\n",
      "ground behind me and gently lower myself onto my butt. I then gradually\n",
      "slide one leg over the edge of the cliff. There’s a small rock jutting out of the\n",
      "cliff side. I rest my foot on it. Then I slide my other foot off the edge and put\n",
      "it on the same small rock. I sit there a moment, leaning back on my palms,\n",
      "wind ruffling my hair. The anxiety is bearable now, as long as I stay focused\n",
      "on the horizon.\n",
      "Then I sit up straight and look down the cliff again. Fear shoots back up\n",
      "through my spine, electrifying my limbs and laser-focusing my mind on the\n",
      "exact coordinates of every inch of my body. The fear is stifling at times. But\n",
      "each time it stifles me, I empty my thoughts, focus my attention on the\n",
      "bottom of the cliff below me, force myself to gaze at \n",
      "my potential doom, and\n",
      "then to simply acknowledge its existence.\n",
      "I was now sitting on the edge of the world, at the southern-most tip of\n",
      "hope, the gateway to the east. The feeling was exhilarating. I can feel the\n",
      "adrenaline pumping through my body. Being so still, so conscious, never felt\n",
      "so thrilling. I listen to the wind and watch the ocean and look out upon the\n",

      "good.\n",
      "Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it\n",
      "obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most peoplewhittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and\n",
      "attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death\n",
      "confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is\n",
